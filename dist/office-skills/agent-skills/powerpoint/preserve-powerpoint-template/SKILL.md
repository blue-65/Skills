# Preserve a PowerPoint template

## Outcome

Reuse the source deck's native master and layout hierarchy while replacing content safely.

## Required context

- Read [the Office output contract](../../../references/office-output-contract.md) before acting.
- Read [the repository design contract](../../../DESIGN.md) before making visual decisions.
- Read [the powerpoint production reference](../../../references/powerpoint-production.md) for format-specific requirements.
- If the target project has its own `DESIGN.md` or a supplied template, apply it before this repository default.
- Apply this precedence: user request, supplied template or source, project design system, this skill, repository defaults.

## Runtime boundary

- This skill supplies a workflow contract, not a bundled content-authoring engine.
- Select a host-provided Office artifact runtime or run the included Windows COM preflight described in [execution runtime](../../../references/execution-runtime.md) before editing.
- Resolve included scripts from the installed distribution root that contains `agent-skills`, `references`, and `scripts`; do not assume the caller's current working directory.
- Use the included static scanner for package evidence, while recognizing that static inspection cannot prove layout, calculation, or application behavior.
- If no compatible authoring and rendering runtime is available, stop after a clearly labeled plan or skeleton and report the artifact as `INCONCLUSIVE`.

## Workflow

1. Inspect all masters, layouts, placeholders, theme tokens, and representative slides.
2. Select source layouts whose hierarchy and media frames match the new content.
3. Duplicate or instantiate layouts and edit inherited placeholders in place.
4. Make repeated changes at the layout level and global changes at the master only when authorized.
5. Avoid mixing the template with an unrelated layout library.
6. Render representative descendants after every master or layout change.

## Required companion workflows

- For external claims, metrics, or assets, use [manage-office-sources](../../common/manage-office-sources/SKILL.md) and [audit-office-claims](../../common/audit-office-claims/SKILL.md); unresolved evidence remains `unverified`.
- Before delivery, run [verify-powerpoint](../verify-powerpoint/SKILL.md).


## Verification

- Give every slide one narrative job and one primary claim.
- Preserve masters, layouts, placeholders, notes, and native editability.
- Render every slide and run the slide show for motion, media, links, or triggers.
- No inherited element was flattened without reason.
- Placeholder types and reading order remain correct.
- Font, footer, and page-marker behavior matches the source.

## Failure boundaries

- Do not overwrite the only source copy.
- Do not add macros, ActiveX, executable content, or external data connections without explicit authorization.
- Do not claim a feature or visual state was verified when it was only inferred from text, XML, or code.
- Treat a skipped required scan, render, calculation, or runtime check as `INCONCLUSIVE`, not `PASS`.
- If three repair cycles do not converge, stop and report the remaining defects and attempted fixes.
