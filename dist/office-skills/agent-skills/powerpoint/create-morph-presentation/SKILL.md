# Create a Morph presentation

## Outcome

Produce a planned set of Morph pairs with stable object naming, controlled state changes, static comprehensibility, and live slideshow verification.

## Required context

- Read [the Office output contract](../../../references/office-output-contract.md) before acting.
- Read [the repository design contract](../../../DESIGN.md) before making visual decisions.
- Read [the powerpoint production reference](../../../references/powerpoint-production.md) for format-specific requirements.
- If the target project has its own `DESIGN.md` or a supplied template, apply it before this repository default.
- Apply this precedence: user request, supplied template or source, project design system, this skill, repository defaults.

## Runtime boundary

- This skill supplies a workflow contract, not a bundled content-authoring engine.
- Select a host-provided Office artifact runtime or run the included Windows COM preflight described in [execution runtime](../../../references/execution-runtime.md) before editing.
- Resolve included scripts from the installed distribution root that contains `agent-skills`, `references`, and `scripts`; do not assume the caller's current working directory.
- Use the included static scanner for package evidence, while recognizing that static inspection cannot prove layout, calculation, or application behavior.
- If no compatible authoring and rendering runtime is available, stop after a clearly labeled plan or skeleton and report the artifact as `INCONCLUSIVE`.

## Workflow

1. Write the communication brief and Morph pair plan before building slides.
2. Define scene objects, shared actor names, state changes, and ghost lifecycles.
3. Duplicate source slides so shared objects retain identity.
4. Change only properties required for the intended movement or transformation.
5. Provide a static reading path for PDF and reduced-motion contexts.
6. Run the actual slide show and audit every Morph pair.

## Required companion workflows

- For external claims, metrics, or assets, use [manage-office-sources](../../common/manage-office-sources/SKILL.md) and [audit-office-claims](../../common/audit-office-claims/SKILL.md); unresolved evidence remains `unverified`.
- Before delivery, run [verify-powerpoint](../verify-powerpoint/SKILL.md).


## Verification

- Give every slide one narrative job and one primary claim.
- Preserve masters, layouts, placeholders, notes, and native editability.
- Render every slide and run the slide show for motion, media, links, or triggers.
- Shared objects use consistent names.
- Each Morph communicates a real state change.
- Static renders remain understandable.
- Live slideshow behavior was tested in Microsoft PowerPoint.

## Failure boundaries

- Do not overwrite the only source copy.
- Do not add macros, ActiveX, executable content, or external data connections without explicit authorization.
- Do not claim a feature or visual state was verified when it was only inferred from text, XML, or code.
- Treat a skipped required scan, render, calculation, or runtime check as `INCONCLUSIVE`, not `PASS`.
- If three repair cycles do not converge, stop and report the remaining defects and attempted fixes.
