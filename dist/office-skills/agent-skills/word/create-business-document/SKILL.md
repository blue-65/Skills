# Create a business document

## Outcome

Produce a readable, semantic DOCX whose structure, styles, tables, fields, and pagination remain editable in Word.

## Required context

- Read [the Office output contract](../../../references/office-output-contract.md) before acting.
- Read [the repository design contract](../../../DESIGN.md) before making visual decisions.
- Read [the word production reference](../../../references/word-production.md) for format-specific requirements.
- If the target project has its own `DESIGN.md` or a supplied template, apply it before this repository default.
- Apply this precedence: user request, supplied template or source, project design system, this skill, repository defaults.

## Runtime boundary

- This skill supplies a workflow contract, not a bundled content-authoring engine.
- Select a host-provided Office artifact runtime or run the included Windows COM preflight described in [execution runtime](../../../references/execution-runtime.md) before editing.
- Resolve included scripts from the installed distribution root that contains `agent-skills`, `references`, and `scripts`; do not assume the caller's current working directory.
- Use the included static scanner for package evidence, while recognizing that static inspection cannot prove layout, calculation, or application behavior.
- If no compatible authoring and rendering runtime is available, stop after a clearly labeled plan or skeleton and report the artifact as `INCONCLUSIVE`.

## Workflow

1. Choose the document archetype, audience, reading mode, and page budget.
2. Define the heading outline and information form for each section before drafting.
3. Apply real Word styles, numbering, captions, page setup, headers, and footers.
4. Use tables only for comparable row-and-column data.
5. Add sources, links, alt text, and document metadata.
6. Update fields, save, render every page, and repair pagination defects.

## Required companion workflows

- For external claims, metrics, or assets, use [manage-office-sources](../../common/manage-office-sources/SKILL.md) and [audit-office-claims](../../common/audit-office-claims/SKILL.md); unresolved evidence remains `unverified`.
- Before delivery, run [verify-office-deliverable](../../common/verify-office-deliverable/SKILL.md) with the Word production checks.


## Verification

- Use real Word styles, fields, numbering, captions, sections, and table geometry.
- Update fields and the table of contents before saving the final DOCX.
- Render and inspect every page; structural extraction is not visual verification.
- Heading levels are logical and no headings are faked with direct formatting.
- Lists use real numbering definitions.
- Tables fit the page and contain no fixed-height clipping.

## Failure boundaries

- Do not overwrite the only source copy.
- Do not add macros, ActiveX, executable content, or external data connections without explicit authorization.
- Do not claim a feature or visual state was verified when it was only inferred from text, XML, or code.
- Treat a skipped required scan, render, calculation, or runtime check as `INCONCLUSIVE`, not `PASS`.
- If three repair cycles do not converge, stop and report the remaining defects and attempted fixes.
