# Create a business report

## Outcome

Produce a navigable report with a clear method, evidence trail, findings, implications, and actionable recommendations.

## Required context

- Read [the Office output contract](../../../references/office-output-contract.md) before acting.
- Read [the repository design contract](../../../DESIGN.md) before making visual decisions.
- Read [the word production reference](../../../references/word-production.md) for format-specific requirements.
- If the target project has its own `DESIGN.md` or a supplied template, apply it before this repository default.
- Apply this precedence: user request, supplied template or source, project design system, this skill, repository defaults.

## Runtime boundary

- This skill supplies a workflow contract, not a bundled content-authoring engine.
- Select a host-provided Office artifact runtime or run the included Windows COM preflight described in [execution runtime](../../../references/execution-runtime.md) before editing.
- Resolve included scripts from the installed distribution root that contains `agent-skills`, `references`, and `scripts`; do not assume the caller's current working directory.
- Use the included static scanner for package evidence, while recognizing that static inspection cannot prove layout, calculation, or application behavior.
- If no compatible authoring and rendering runtime is available, stop after a clearly labeled plan or skeleton and report the artifact as `INCONCLUSIVE`.

## Workflow

1. Define the report question, scope, audience, method, and evidence boundary.
2. Build the outline around findings and decisions rather than source order.
3. Use figures and tables only when they improve comparison or comprehension.
4. Distinguish observation, analysis, limitation, and recommendation.
5. Add captions, cross-references, page numbers, and a usable contents structure.
6. Verify citations and inspect every page for continuity and page breaks.

## Required companion workflows

- For external claims, metrics, or assets, use [manage-office-sources](../../common/manage-office-sources/SKILL.md) and [audit-office-claims](../../common/audit-office-claims/SKILL.md); unresolved evidence remains `unverified`.
- Before delivery, run [verify-office-deliverable](../../common/verify-office-deliverable/SKILL.md) with the Word production checks.


## Verification

- Use real Word styles, fields, numbering, captions, sections, and table geometry.
- Update fields and the table of contents before saving the final DOCX.
- Render and inspect every page; structural extraction is not visual verification.
- Findings are supported by the described method.
- Limitations qualify the conclusion without swallowing it.
- Figures and tables are referenced in the surrounding text.

## Failure boundaries

- Do not overwrite the only source copy.
- Do not add macros, ActiveX, executable content, or external data connections without explicit authorization.
- Do not claim a feature or visual state was verified when it was only inferred from text, XML, or code.
- Treat a skipped required scan, render, calculation, or runtime check as `INCONCLUSIVE`, not `PASS`.
- If three repair cycles do not converge, stop and report the remaining defects and attempted fixes.
