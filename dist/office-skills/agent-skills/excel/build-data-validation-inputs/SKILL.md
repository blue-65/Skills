# Build Excel data-entry controls

## Outcome

Produce a clear input experience that protects calculations while keeping data typed, validated, and easy to complete.

## Required context

- Read [the Office output contract](../../../references/office-output-contract.md) before acting.
- Read [the repository design contract](../../../DESIGN.md) before making visual decisions.
- Read [the excel production reference](../../../references/excel-production.md) for format-specific requirements.
- If the target project has its own `DESIGN.md` or a supplied template, apply it before this repository default.
- Apply this precedence: user request, supplied template or source, project design system, this skill, repository defaults.

## Runtime boundary

- This skill supplies a workflow contract, not a bundled content-authoring engine.
- Select a host-provided Office artifact runtime or run the included Windows COM preflight described in [execution runtime](../../../references/execution-runtime.md) before editing.
- Resolve included scripts from the installed distribution root that contains `agent-skills`, `references`, and `scripts`; do not assume the caller's current working directory.
- Use the included static scanner for package evidence, while recognizing that static inspection cannot prove layout, calculation, or application behavior.
- If no compatible authoring and rendering runtime is available, stop after a clearly labeled plan or skeleton and report the artifact as `INCONCLUSIVE`.

## Workflow

1. Define every input field, data type, allowed values, required state, and downstream use.
2. Separate inputs from formulas and protect calculation areas.
3. Create named lookup ranges and validation rules.
4. Use input messages and concise instructions near the entry area.
5. Highlight invalid or missing entries without relying only on color.
6. Test valid, invalid, blank, pasted, and boundary inputs.

## Required companion workflows

- For external claims, metrics, or assets, use [manage-office-sources](../../common/manage-office-sources/SKILL.md) and [audit-office-claims](../../common/audit-office-claims/SKILL.md); unresolved evidence remains `unverified`.
- Before delivery, run [verify-excel-workbook](../verify-excel-workbook/SKILL.md).


## Verification

- Store typed values and make derived outputs formula-driven and auditable.
- Recalculate in the target application and trace representative outputs to inputs.
- Render every used sheet or intended print area after scanning formula errors.
- Validation references remain valid after save and reopen.
- Users can identify editable cells.
- Pasted data cannot silently bypass critical controls.

## Failure boundaries

- Do not overwrite the only source copy.
- Do not add macros, ActiveX, executable content, or external data connections without explicit authorization.
- Do not claim a feature or visual state was verified when it was only inferred from text, XML, or code.
- Treat a skipped required scan, render, calculation, or runtime check as `INCONCLUSIVE`, not `PASS`.
- If three repair cycles do not converge, stop and report the remaining defects and attempted fixes.
